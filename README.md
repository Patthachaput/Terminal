CODE : https://github.com/Patthachaput/Terminal.git

Note  - All are from project 1, except the name that has no title
         - No example files
         - use can type anything to log in as we are not checking it, and assume the log in
           value to be true
                
Currently working
- create data structure
    a. Register User
    b. Create Auction
- navigate to some pages

Partly working
- login ( assume successful login - no function to browse to check the validity of email and password )
- Interface ( missing bid page and show browse product )
- validation ( does not check email and address validatation )
- write data to file ( finished the functions but did not fully test, so we didn't call them in the main interface )
- category browse ( Have function but does not call )

Not available
- view bid history
- view sale history
- edit personal info
- bid product
- browse product by date, bid price

Questions
1. Is it possible to write the data in pointer in structure to file ?
2. Is nessary to hide password when log in ?
